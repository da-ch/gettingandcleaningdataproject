Variables
=========

There are 68 variables are in the tidy data set. They are:

1. Subject - An identifier for the person who's activity was measured.
2. Activity - The descriptive name of the measured activity.
3. 66 other variables which are the mean value per activity per subject of the estimated means and standard deviations of each of the signals below ("XYZ" is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions): 

* TimeBodyAccelerationXYZ - Time domain signal at constant rate of 50Hz; one variable for each of the X, Y and Z directions.
* TimeGravityAccelerationXYZ - Time domain signal at constant rate of 50Hz; one variable for each of the X, Y and Z directions.
* TimeBodyAccelerationJerkXYZ - Time domain signal at constant rate of 50Hz; one variable for each of the X, Y and Z directions.
* TimeBodyGyroXYZ - Time domain signal at constant rate of 50Hz; one variable for each of the X, Y and Z directions.
* TimeBodyGyroJerkXYZ - Time domain signal at constant rate of 50Hz; one variable for each of the X, Y and Z directions.
* TimeBodyAccelerationMagnitude - Time domain signal at constant rate of 50Hz; magnitutde calculated using the Euclidian norm.
* TimeGravityAccelerationMagnitude - Time domain signal at constant rate of 50Hz; magnitutde calculated using the Euclidian norm.
* TimeBodyAccelerationJerkMagnitude - Time domain signal at constant rate of 50Hz; magnitutde calculated using the Euclidian norm.
